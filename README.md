Academic Context: Part of MSc Biotechnology program

1. Synopsis
Objective:
To isolate fungal pathogens affecting potatoes and evaluate the antifungal efficacy of biocontrol agents and plant extracts through in vitro assays and plant bioassays.

Study Design:
Experimental, lab-based study using disk diffusion, dual culture techniques, and salicylic acid estimation.

Methods:
. Fungal isolation on PDA from infected potato samples
. Disk diffusion assays using antibiotics, Trichoderma, Pseudomonas, and plant extracts
. Infected leaf and tuber bioassay
. Salicylic acid estimation via spectrophotometry

Key Results:
. _Trichoderma_ showed strong inhibition against both Colletotrichum and Aspergillus
. Aloe vera extract showed high salicylic acid induction in tissues
. Pseudomonas showed no significant inhibition
. Results confirm potential of certain biocontrol agents and extracts as eco-friendly fungicide alternatives

Conclusion:
Biocontrol agents like Trichoderma and plant extracts like Aloevera demonstrated promising antifungal activity and defense induction in potato, offering sustainable disease management solutions.


2. Introduction
Potatoes are highly susceptible to fungal infections such as black dot (Colletotrichum coccodes) and black mold rot (Aspergillus niger), leading to yield and postharvest losses. The study explores alternatives to chemical fungicides by evaluating biocontrol agents (Trichoderma, Pseudomonas) and plant extracts (e.g., aloe vera, shatavari, onion) for their antagonistic activity and ability to induce plant immune responses via salicylic acid production.


3. Methods
**Fungal Isolation & Identification**
Samples: Infected leaves and tubers from market
Medium: Potato Dextrose Agar
Identification: Morphology + Microscopy ( Colletotrichum, Aspergillus)

**Agar Disk Diffusion Assays**
Antibiotic Sensitivity: Ampicillin, Tetracycline, etc.
Biocontrol Activity: Trichoderma, Pseudomonas
Plant Extract Sensitivity: Aloe vera, shatavari, onion, etc.

**Plant Bioassay**
Pre-treatment of sterilized potato leaf/tuber samples with biocontrol agents and extracts
Fungal inoculation after 8 hrs, followed by incubation and observation

**Salicylic Acid Estimation in Pre-treated Leaf and Tuber samples**
Colorimetric assay using ferric chloride reagent
Absorbance measured at 525 nm to evaluate defense response


4. Results
**Fungal Identification**
Colletotrichum: grey, cottony colonies; acervuli and cylindrical conidia
Aspergillus: white with black spores; long conidiophores and round conidia

**Antibiotic sensitivity test**
Disk diffusion assays showed Trichoderma and Aloe vera extract had the highest antifungal activity, significantly inhibiting both Colletotrichum and Aspergillus. Commercial fungicide also proved effective at 5%. Pseudomonas showed no visible inhibition. Infected tissue assays further confirmed reduced infection severity in pre-treated samples.

**Salicylic Acid Concentration (Âµg/mL)**
. Highest levels in Aloe vera (2) and Trichoderma pre-treated samples
. Indicates plant defense activation in both tuber and leaf samples

5. Discussion
The study validates the antifungal effect of Trichoderma and Aloe vera on potato pathogens. Increased salicylic acid levels in pretreated tissues suggest enhanced systemic resistance. Pseudomonas lacked visible inhibition in vitro. This work highlights the relevance of eco-friendly, biologically derived treatments over chemical fungicides.

6. Conclusion
Trichoderma and Aloe vera extract emerged as effective treatments to inhibit fungal pathogens and stimulate plant immunity in potatoes. These findings support sustainable, non-toxic crop protection alternatives.
